    "# Understanding the Relationship Between Tools and React Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code snippets define a custom React Agent (`myChatGPTReactAgent`) and a set of tools in `tools.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Agent (`react_agent.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The React Agent is designed to handle queries using the Language Model (LM) from OpenAI (GPT-3.5 Turbo in this case). The agent is structured to be flexible, allowing the integration of various tools to enhance its query processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The agent initializes with a specific LM and a template for handling queries.\n",
    "2. **Tool Addition**: The agent can add tools (from `tools.py`) to its toolkit, expanding its functionality.\n",
    "3. **Agent Running**: The agent uses the LM and the added tools to process a given query and return a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools (`tools.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools are essentially functions designed to perform specific tasks that can be utilized by the React Agent. Each tool is wrapped in the `Tool` class, giving it a standardized structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provided Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Search Tool**: Performs SQL searches on a company database.\n",
    "2. **Job Description Search Tool**: Conducts similarity searches on job descriptions.\n",
    "3. **Measure Length Tool**: Measures the length of a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship Between Tools and React Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "- The React Agent uses these tools to enhance its response capabilities. \n",
    "- When a query is received, the agent can leverage one or more tools to process the query, depending on the requirements.\n",
    "- Tools can be seen as extensions of the agent, providing specialized functionalities that are not inherently part of the LM's capabilities.\n"
