    "# Evaluating Language Model Agents with RAGAS\n",
    "The provided code snippet is designed to evaluate language model (LM) agents using RAGAS (Relevance and Generation Assessment Suite). Before diving into the specifics of the code, let's understand what RAGAS is and how it can be applied to evaluate LLM agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAGAS?\n",
    "RAGAS, or Relevance and Generation Assessment Suite, is an evaluation framework for assessing the performance of language models, especially in the context of generating relevant and accurate responses. RAGAS focuses on several key metrics to measure the quality of the responses generated by a language model. These metrics typically include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Faithfulness: How well the response sticks to the truth and accuracy regarding the source content.\n",
    "2. Answer Relevancy: The relevance of the generated answer to the given query.\n",
    "3. Context Precision: The accuracy with which the context is used in generating the response.\n",
    "4. Context Recall: The ability of the model to recall and appropriately use relevant context in its response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing RAGAS for LLM Agents Evaluation\n",
    "To implement this framework for evaluating your LLM agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integrate Your LLM Agents: Ensure that your LLM agents can generate results in the format required by the RAGAS evaluator chains.\n",
    "2. Run Evaluations: Use the evaluator chains to assess different aspects of your agents' outputs. You can evaluate the outputs on faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision, and context recall.\n",
    "3. Analyze Results: Analyze the scores returned by each metric to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your LLM agents.\n",
    "4. Iterate and Improve: Based on the evaluation results, iterate on your LLM agents to improve their performance in the assessed areas.\n",
    "5. Write Pytest Tests: In a tests folder, write pytest tests to automatically validate the evaluation chains. This will help ensure that the evaluation metrics are being correctly applied to the agents' responses and that the evaluation process itself is robust and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, by implementing RAGAS, you can get a comprehensive understanding of how well your LLM agents are performing in generating relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses. This can be crucial for refining and improving the capabilities of your language models.\n",
